#  First foray into SwiftData (didn't even bother to learn Core Date, barely know Swift and SwiftUI)

* Only possible because of this amazing guy, [Tunds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLNNNXD8X2U&list=PLnwKMRkI_5ddd5uGpPPtHooB6rLYdnosZ&index=9)

## Will add other useful links as I learn about them

* Learned how to do dynamic predicates from [Alfian Losari](https://github.com/alfianlosari/NoteAppSwiftData/tree/main)
